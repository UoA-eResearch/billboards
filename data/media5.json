With 6 lanes of traffic heading at this billboard, it really delivers against a huge and desirable inner city audience heading to the North Shore, Wynyard Quarter and Ponsonby. With six 16 second slots available the billboard will rotate through creatives while ensuring there is a sufficient amount of time for each ad.",
